The protocol establishes a shared secret between two communicating parties using Diffie–Hellman and then provides one-way key confirmation. Both parties operate in an agreed cyclic group of prime order with a publicly known generator g. No long-term keys or certificates are assumed; each side only knows the other’s identifier and the common group parameters. The goal is to keep the Diffie–Hellman result g^(x·y) confidential to the two participants and to use it as the basis of a channel key.

The exchange begins when the party that starts the session samples a fresh ephemeral exponent x uniformly at random and transmits the public value g^x. Upon receipt, the peer validates that this value is a legitimate group element (for elliptic curves, a valid point; for finite-field groups, a non-trivial element in the correct subgroup). The peer then samples its own fresh exponent y and responds with g^y. After this two-message handshake, each side can compute the common Diffie–Hellman secret: the initiator raises g^y to the power x, while the peer raises g^x to the power y; both computations yield the same value g^(x·y).

To provide explicit confirmation that the shared secret matches, the initiator generates a fresh nonce n and sends an authenticated-encryption ciphertext produced under a key derived from g^(x·y).
