Protocol DIFFIE_HELLMAN specifies a basic Diffie–Hellman key exchange between two agents, A and B, followed by a one-way key confirmation from A to B using symmetric encryption under the derived shared key. Both A and B know a public generator g() for a cyclic group in which the discrete logarithm problem is assumed to be hard. Each party chooses its own fresh secret exponent: A chooses x, and B chooses y. The shared Diffie–Hellman key is the group element (g()^x)^y, which equals (g()^y)^x and is intended to be known only to A and B. This value is then used as a symmetric key in the senc{·} operator.

The protocol begins with A’s contribution in message dh_1. A selects a fresh secret exponent x and sends g()^x to B. This value is public but, under the assumed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem, does not by itself reveal x. Upon receiving g()^x, B chooses its own fresh secret exponent y and replies with message dh_2, sending g()^y to A. At the end of these two messages, A can compute the shared value ((g()^y)^x = g()^{xy}, and B can compute \((g()^x)^y = g()^{xy}; both obtain the same group element, which is taken to be the shared key K = (g()^x)^y.

In the final message dh_3, A provides a form of key confirmation and demonstrates use of the derived key. A selects a fresh nonce n and sends senc{ n }((g()^x)^y) to B, where the shared Diffie–Hellman value ((g()^x)^yis used as the symmetric encryption key. Only a party that has correctly computed the same Diffie–Hellman result can decrypt this message and recovern. When B successfully decrypts dh_3using its local version of the shared key and obtains a well-formed noncen`, B gains confidence that A also computed the same shared key and is actively participating in the current protocol run.

The intended security goals are that the shared value ((g()^x)^y remains secret between A and B and is not disclosed to any other principal, and that A authenticates B on this shared key in the sense that A believes it is sharing \((g()^x)^y specifically with B. The shared key is designated as the channel key K(A,B) for subsequent secure communication from A to B. No explicit channel key is defined for the reverse direction in the specification, but the protocol’s main function is to establish the common Diffie–Hellman key and to demonstrate its use via A’s encrypted nonce in the final step.
