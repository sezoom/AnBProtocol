Protocol ISO_onepass_pk specifies a one-pass, public-key–based data-origin authentication mechanism from a claimant A to a verifier B. Each agent X possesses a public–private key pair (pk(X), sk(X)). The public keys pk(A) and pk(B) are assumed to be known system-wide, while the private keys sk(A) and sk(B) are known only to their respective owners. The protocol uses an asymmetric “aenc” primitive in two modes: when applied with sk(A) it represents a signature-like operation (encryption with A’s private key, verifiable with pk(A)), providing authenticity but not confidentiality. The goal is for B to obtain assurance that an application field Text1 originates from A and is bound to a fresh nonce NA and to B as intended recipient.

The protocol consists of a single message from A to B. In message m1, A sends two signed structures. The first component, aenc{ tagISO_onepass_pk1 . A . pk(A) }sk(A), is effectively a self-signed certificate or identity assertion. It binds A’s identity and its public key pk(A) under A’s private key using a mechanism-specific tag tagISO_onepass_pk1. This allows B to verify, using pk(A), that the structure was created by the holder of sk(A) and to associate the rest of the message with that claimant. The second component, aenc{ tagISO_onepass_pk2 . NA . B . Text1 }sk(A), is a signature on the tuple consisting of a second mechanism-specific tag tagISO_onepass_pk2, a freshly chosen nonce NA, the intended verifier’s identity B, and the application data Text1. Including NA provides freshness when combined with B’s replay checks; including B prevents the same signed content from being safely reused towards a different recipient; and including Text1 assures that this application value is authenticated and bound to the specific run.

Upon receiving m1, B uses the publicly known pk(A) to verify both signed components. From the first, B confirms that the sender controls sk(A) and is indeed A; from the second, B recovers NA, B, and Text1, and verifies that the signature is valid and consistent with its own identity B. If the verification succeeds and NA is accepted as fresh, B concludes that Text1 was generated by A in the context of this execution of the ISO one-pass mechanism, and that A was live at the time of generation. The stated goal B ->* A : Text1 expresses that B non-injectively authenticates A on Text1: whenever B accepts Text1 via this protocol, there exists some run in which A produced a matching signed message under sk(A). The mechanism does not provide mutual authentication nor key establishment; it strictly offers one-way, public-key–based data-origin authentication from A to B for the field Text1.
