# Protocol Five

This is a three-pass symmetric-key authentication and confirmation protocol between A and B, using their shared secret key kAB and a hash function h.

1. A initiates the exchange by sending A and B identities, a nonce n, and its hash h(n), encrypted under the shared key.
2. B responds with a nonce m, encrypted with the same key, to provide freshness and confirm shared-key possession.
3. A returns the hash of B’s nonce m, encrypted under kAB, confirming it received and correctly decrypted B’s message.

Security properties:
* Ensures mutual authentication, each party proves knowledge of kAB.
* Provides freshness via nonces n and m.
* Maintains confidentiality and integrity of exchanged values through symmetric encryption and hashing.
