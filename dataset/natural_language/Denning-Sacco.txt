Protocol DenningSacco specifies a symmetric key–distribution and data-protection mechanism in which a trusted server S provides a fresh session key kAB for use between two agents A and B. A and S share a long-term symmetric key skAS, and B and S share a long-term symmetric key skBS. These long-term keys are used only to protect communication with S and are assumed to be known exclusively to the respective pairs (A,S) and (B,S). The session key kAB is intended to be used subsequently by A and B as a bidirectional channel key. A timestamp or validity parameter t is included in the server’s messages to constrain the lifetime of the session key. Symmetric encryption under a key K is written as senc{…}K.

The protocol begins when A requests a key for communication with B. In message m1, A sends A.B to S, identifying itself and the intended peer B. This request does not need to be confidential, but it informs S that A wishes to establish a fresh session key with B.

Upon receiving the request, S generates a session key kAB and associates it with a validity parameter t (for example, a timestamp or an expiration time). S then constructs message m2, sent to A as
senc{ B . kAB . t . senc{ A . kAB . t }skBS }skAS.
The outer encryption under skAS ensures that only A can read this response. Inside, S includes the identity of B, the session key kAB, the validity parameter t, and a “ticket” for B: senc{ A . kAB . t }skBS, which is encrypted under the long-term key skBS known only to B (and S). On decrypting m2 using skAS, A learns kAB, confirms that the ticket is for B, and obtains the validity information t. A does not modify the ticket itself.

In message m3, A forwards the ticket senc{ A . kAB . t }skBS to B. Since this component is encrypted under skBS, A cannot read or alter its contents beyond forwarding it. B decrypts the ticket with skBS and thus recovers A’s identity, the session key kAB, and the associated parameter t. At this point, both A and B share the session key kAB, which they may use for secure communication in both directions; it is designated as K(A,B) and K(B,A).

Once kAB is established, B can send application data securely to A. In message m4, B sends senc{ payload }kAB, where payload represents the data B wishes to deliver to A. Because this message is encrypted under kAB, only a party that knows kAB—intended to be A—can recover the payload. When A successfully decrypts m4 and obtains payload, A gains assurance that the data came from someone who knows kAB, which, given the preceding key distribution steps, should be B.

The intended security goals are that kAB remains secret between A and B and is not disclosed to other parties, and that B non-injectively authenticates to A on the value payload (expressed as B ->* A : payload). In other words, whenever A accepts a payload protected under kAB, there exists a corresponding run in which B sent that payload encrypted with the same session key. The session key kAB is used as the channel key in both directions for subsequent secure communication.
