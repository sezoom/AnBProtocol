The unilateral authentication mechanism is two-pass protocol built on a pre-shared symmetric key and authenticated encryption. The verifier starts by sending a role/tag identifier (tagITS1) and a fresh challenge NB. The tag cleanly separates this mechanism (and this exact message role) from any others in the system, while the time-variant parameter NB delivers freshness and replay resistance—exactly the requirement ISO/IEC 9798 places on its symmetric-key mechanisms.  ￼

The claimant replies with a single ciphertext under the shared key: senc{ tagITS2 · NB · B · Text2 }sk(A,B). On receipt, the verifier decrypts and verifies. If valid, the verifier learns that the sender currently possesses the shared key and accepts Text2 as fresh and authentic for this run (via NB), peer-bound (the tuple includes the verifier identifier B, preventing simple reflection/UKS confusions), and confidential (because it is inside the authenticated-encryption payload). In modern profiles of the standard, senc is instantiated by an AEAD (e.g., AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305); implementers MUST manage AEAD nonces correctly and SHOULD bind a transcript/identifier as associated data to ensure context separation.  ￼

Scope and limits. The mechanism authenticates the claimant to the verifier (data-origin authentication for Text2) in just two messages; it does not authenticate the verifier back to the claimant, establish a fresh session key, or provide forward secrecy. If mutual authentication or key establishment is needed, compose this step with the appropriate two- or three-pass mechanisms in the same ISO family or with a DH-based AKE, binding the transcript into any derived keys. These properties and design choices match ISO/IEC 9798’s Part 2 model (symmetric/AEAD mechanisms) and its Part 1 guidance on time-variant parameters.  ￼
