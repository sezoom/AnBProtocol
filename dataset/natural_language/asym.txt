# Asym Protocol

This is a simple one-pass asymmetric protocol for message transmission.

Flow:

1. A → B: `aenc{ n }_{sk(A)}` — A sends a nonce n encrypted (effectively signed) with its private key.

Purpose:

The message serves to prove A’s identity to B, since only A can produce something decryptable with `pk(A)`.

Security analysis:

* Authentication: B can verify that the message originated from A.
* Secrecy: *Not achieved* — because `aenc{n}_{sk(A)}` is a signature, anyone knowing `pk(A)` can decrypt it; thus n is not secret.
* The stated goal `n secret between A,B` therefore does not hold.

Summary:
Asym provides authenticity (proof of origin) but no confidentiality for n.
