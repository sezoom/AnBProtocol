Protocol Asym defines a minimal one-pass authentication mechanism in which agent A proves knowledge of its private key to agent B by signing a fresh value. Each agent X possesses a public key pk(X) and a corresponding private key sk(X). The public keys pk(A) and pk(B) are available to both parties and to the environment, while the private keys sk(A) and sk(B) are known only to their respective owners. The protocol uses aenc{ · }sk(A) to denote a public-key signature-like operation by A (encryption under A’s private key, verifiable using pk(A)).

The protocol consists of a single message. A chooses a fresh value n (intended to act as a nonce or challenge) and sends message a1 to B:
aenc{ n }sk(A).
Upon receiving this message, B uses A’s public key pk(A) to verify the ciphertext and recover n. If decryption/verification succeeds and yields a well-formed value, B concludes that the message originated from the holder of sk(A) and thus authenticates A on the value n. The stated goal B -> A : n expresses that whenever B accepts n as valid in this protocol, B believes it was generated and signed by A. No session keys are established and no further messages are exchanged; the protocol serves solely as a simple asymmetric-key–based authenticity proof for the value n.
