# Protocol ISO_onepass_symm

This protocol is a one-pass symmetric key exchange between A and B.
A sends a single encrypted message to B. A uses the shared secret key sk(A,B) to encrypt a fresh nonce nA, B’s identity, and a message m.
This provides confidentiality and weak assurance that the message came from someone knowing sk(A,B).
