# Protocol Eight

This is a four-step asymmetric-key authentication protocol between A (the initiator) and B (the responder), using public-key encryption (`aenc`), signatures (implicit via private-key encryption with `sk()`), and a hash function `h`.

1. A sends a message M signed with its private key, allowing B to verify A’s identity and message integrity.
2. B includes its public key and identity, plus a signed nonce N for freshness and authentication.
3. A encrypts B’s nonce N and its own public key under B’s public key, confirming receipt and mutual key knowledge.
4. B finishes by sending a hash over M, B, and N to confirm both parties share the same session context and message history.

Goals:
* B weakly authenticates A on (A, M) (non-injective).
* A weakly authenticates B on (B, N) (non-injective).
