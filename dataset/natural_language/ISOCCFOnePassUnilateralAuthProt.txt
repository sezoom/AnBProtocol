The protocol consists of a single message from claimant to verifier. That message carries: (i) a protocol/tag identifier; (ii) a freshly chosen nonce; (iii) the verifier’s identifier; (iv) an optional, unprotected field (Text2) that can carry auxiliary information but MUST NOT be relied upon for security decisions; (v) a MAC computed over a structured tuple that at least includes a second tag, the shared key, the fresh nonce, the verifier’s identifier, and an authenticated application field Text1; and (vi) the cleartext tuple (nonce, verifier identifier, Text1) so the verifier can recompute and check the MAC. On receipt, the verifier recomputes the MAC under the pre-shared key over the indicated fields; success assures the verifier that the claimant currently knows the key and that Text1 is authentic and bound to this run. This yields data-origin authentication for Text1 and aliveness of the claimant, but only in the direction claimant → verifier (no mutual authentication, no key establishment). Including the verifier’s identifier in the MAC input prevents reflection of the message back to the claimant.  ￼
