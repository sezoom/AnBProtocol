# Andrew Secure RPC Secrecy

Two parties, A (initiator) and B (responder), share a long-term symmetric key `sk(A,B)` and use nonces to achieve mutual authentication and secrecy.

Flow

1. A → B: `A · senc{ nA }_{sk(A,B)}` — A initiates contact and proves knowledge of the shared key by encrypting a fresh nonce nA.
2. B → A: `senc{ succ(nA) · nB }_{sk(A,B)}` — B confirms receipt by returning `succ(nA)` and includes a fresh nonce nB, maintaining continuity and freshness.
3. A → B: `senc{ succ(nB) }_{sk(A,B)}` — A acknowledges nB, confirming mutual possession of the shared key and completing authentication.
4. B → A: `senc{ nB2 }_{sk(A,B)}` — B optionally sends another secret value nB2, protected under the same key.

Goals & Security Properties

* Mutual authentication: Both parties verify each other’s ability to encrypt/decrypt with `sk(A,B)` using the nonce succession pattern (`succ(nA)`, `succ(nB)`).
* Secrecy: `nA`, `nB`, and `nB2` remain confidential between A and B.
* Freshness: Each step involves a fresh nonce to prevent replay attacks.

Summary:
Andrew Secure RPC provides a symmetric-key mutual authentication and secure message exchange protocol that guarantees confidentiality of session data and verification of both parties using a simple nonce succession scheme.
