# CR Protocol

This is a simple challenge–response exchange between client C and responder R, using public-key encryption and a hash for verification.

1. C → R: `aenc{ n }_{pk(R)}` — C sends a fresh nonce n encrypted under R’s public key; only R can decrypt it.
2. R → C: `h(n)` — R replies with the hash of n, proving it successfully decrypted the first message and thus possesses the matching private key.

Security properties:

* Secrecy: n is confidential between C and R (protected by public-key encryption).
* Authentication: C verifies R’s identity — only R can return `h(n)` correctly.
* Freshness: ensured by C’s fresh nonce n.
