# Protocol One

A and B are two agents. They share a symmetric key Ks, known to both A and B. A also possesses a private message M that will later be sent to B.

1. A initiates the protocol by sending a fresh random number Na (nonce) to B.
2. B encrypts the received nonce Na using the shared key Ks and sends it back to A.
3. Upon verifying that B knows Ks, A sends the secret message M of type Data, encrypted with Ks.
