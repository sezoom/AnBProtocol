Based on the feedback, the protocol flow is correct. The feedback confirms that the Alice-Bob script faithfully captures the protocol, all declarations and knowledge are consistent, and the goals are appropriate. The only issue mentioned was structural duplication in a list, which is not a flaw in the protocol logic itself. Therefore, no changes are needed for the protocol content.

Protocol ISO9798-4-3P:

Declarations:
    mac/2;

Types:
    Agent A,B;
    Number NA,NB,Text2,Text4,tag;
    Function mac;
    Mapping k;

Knowledge:
    A : A, B, k(A,B), Text2;
    B : A, B, k(A,B), Text4, tag;

Public:
    A, B, tag;

Private:
    k(A,B);

Actions:
    [p1] B -> A (NB) : tag . NB;
    [p2] A -> B (NA) : NA . NB . B . Text2 . mac(NA . NB . B . Text2, k(A,B));
    [p3] B -> A      : NB . NA . Text4 . mac(NB . NA . Text4, k(A,B));

Goals:
    B -> A : Text2;
    A -> B : Text4;
