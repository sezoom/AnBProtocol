The protocol flow is mostly correct but can be adjusted to use standard Alice-Bob notation and remove redundant type declarations as per stylistic guidelines. Here's the updated protocol:

Protocol CR:  <!-- Protocol name remains consistent with original, though roles are updated -->
Declarations:
    aenc/2;
    h/1;

Types:
    Agent Alice, Bob;  <!-- Renamed from C, R to Alice, Bob -->
    Number n;
    Mapping pk, sk;  <!-- Removed redundant "Function h;" -->

Knowledge:
    Alice : pk(Alice), sk(Alice), pk(Bob), Bob;  <!-- Renamed C to Alice, R to Bob -->
    Bob : pk(Bob), sk(Bob), pk(Alice), Alice;  <!-- Renamed R to Bob, C to Alice -->

Public:
    pk(Alice), pk(Bob);  <!-- Updated to Alice and Bob -->

Private:
    sk(Alice), sk(Bob);  <!-- Updated to Alice and Bob -->

Actions:
    [m1] Alice -> Bob (n) : aenc{ n }pk(Bob);  <!-- Renamed sender/receiver -->
    [m2] Bob -> Alice     : h(n);  <!-- Renamed sender/receiver -->

Goals:
    Bob -> Alice : h(n);  <!-- Updated to reflect Bob authenticating to Alice -->
    n secret between Alice, Bob;  <!-- Updated to Alice and Bob -->

ChannelKeys:

end

**Explanation:**  
- Renamed agents `C` (initiator) and `R` (responder) to `Alice` and `Bob` respectively to align with standard protocol notation, assuming the raw_text intended this convention.  
- Removed `Function h;` from the Types section since `h/1` is already declared in Declarations, eliminating redundancy.  
- All other sections (Declarations, Actions, Goals, Public/Private keys) are updated to use `Alice` and `Bob` while preserving logical correctness. The protocol flow remains valid, with freshness (via `(n)` in m1), encryption, and hashing properly modeled.
