**Explanation:**  
The protocol was updated to address the feedback and ensure correctness:  
1. **Added `aenc/2` declaration** to `Declarations` to comply with the style guide.  
2. **Renamed agents** from `A`/`B` to `Alice`/`Bob` to align with the "Alice–Bob specification" mentioned in the feedback, improving coverage of the raw text.  
3. **Indented `Public` and `Private` sections** for strict adherence to the template.  
4. **Removed `()` in step2** (stylistic improvement, as no fresh values are sent).  
5. **Indented `ChannelKeys` content** (the `;`) to match consistent formatting.
