To address the feedback and improve the protocol flow's correctness and alignment with modeling conventions, here's the revised protocol:

```plaintext
Protocol One:

Declarations:
    senc/2;

Types:
    Agent A,B;
    Number Na;
    Number M;
    Symmetric_key Ks;

Knowledge:
    A : A, B, Ks;
    B : A, B, Ks;

Public:

Private:
    Ks, M;

Actions:
    [step1] A -> B (Na) : Na;
    [step2] B -> A      : senc{Na}Ks;
    [step3] A -> B (M)  : senc{M}Ks;

Goals:
    M secret between A,B;

ChannelKeys:

end
```

**Key Updates:**  
1. **Type Declarations:** Separated `Na` (nonce) and `M` (payload) under distinct `Number` lines for clarity (`Number Na; Number M;`).  
2. **Knowledge Section:** Removed `M` from A’s initial knowledge to align with the intent that `M` is a fresh, session-specific value generated by A during execution (step3).  
3. **Action Step3:** Added `(M)` to the fresh list to explicitly denote `M` as a newly generated value by A before encryption.  

These changes preserve the core protocol logic while clarifying semantic intent and adhering to suggested style guide conventions.
