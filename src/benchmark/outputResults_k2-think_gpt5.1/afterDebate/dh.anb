To address the feedback and correct the protocol flow, we need to formalize exponentiation and multiplication operations using declared function symbols, update the `Types` section to include these functions, and ensure stylistic consistency in the `Private` section. Here's the revised protocol:

```plaintext
Protocol DHKeyConfirm:

Declarations:
    exp/2;
    mul/2;
    g/0;
    kdf/1;
    senc/2;

Types:
    Agent A,B;
    Number x,y,n;
    Function kdf, exp, mul;

Knowledge:
    A : A, B, g();
    B : B, A, g();

Public:
    g();

Private:
    ;

Actions:
    [step1] A -> B (x) : exp(g(),x);
    [step2] B -> A (y) : exp(g(),y);
    [step3] A -> B (n) : senc{ n }kdf(exp(g(), mul(x,y)));

Goals:
    exp(g(), mul(x,y)) secret between A,B;

ChannelKeys:
    K(A,B): kdf(exp(g(), mul(x,y)));

end
```

**Explanation of Changes:**  
1. **Declarations Section:** Added `exp/2` (exponentiation function) and `mul/2` (multiplication function) to explicitly declare these operations, replacing the implicit `^` and `*` operators.  
2. **Types Section:** Updated `Function` to include `exp` and `mul`, ensuring consistency with the template requirement that uninterpreted functions declared in `Declarations` are listed here.  
3. **Actions Section:** Replaced `g()^x` with `exp(g(),x)` in step 1, `g()^y` with `exp(g(),y)` in step 2, and `g()^(x*y)` with `exp(g(), mul(x,y))` in step 3 to align with the declared functions.  
4. **Goals Section:** Updated the secrecy goal to reference `exp(g(), mul(x,y))` instead of `g()^(x*y)`.  
5. **ChannelKeys Section:** Updated the key definition to use `exp(g(), mul(x,y))` in `kdf`.  
6. **Private Section:** Added a semicolon `;` for stylistic consistency, addressing the cosmetic feedback about the empty section body.
