Protocol Ten fails to achieve the intended property of B weakly authenticating A on the value Kf with non-injective agreement. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Analysis:
1. **Step 1**: A signs (ID_A, PK_A, Kf), allowing B to verify Kf is bound to A via A’s signature. However, Kf is transmitted in plaintext, making it known to any attacker intercepting the message.  
2. **Step 2**: B sends (ID_B, PK_B, H(Kf)) unauthenticated. This does not bind Kf to B (no authentication), and A cannot confirm B’s identity or the integrity of PK_B.  
3. **Step 3**: A encrypts payload M under Kf, appends IDs, and wraps it in PK_B encryption. B decrypts using SK_B, retrieves (Enc_Kf(M), ID_A, ID_B), checks IDs, then decrypts with Kf.  

### Critical Flaws:
- **Lack of Payload Authentication**: The payload in Step 3 is encrypted with Kf (symmetric) but not signed by A. Since Kf is public (from Step 1), any attacker who intercepts Step 1 can learn Kf, encrypt arbitrary data with it, and forge a payload. B cannot verify that the inner ciphertext (Enc_Kf(M)) was generated by A, as symmetric encryption with a public key does not authenticate the sender.  
- **Unauthenticated B’s Response**: Step 2’s unauthenticated hash acknowledgment (H(Kf)) allows A to confirm Kf receipt but does not secure B’s identity or PK_B. An attacker could substitute B’s PK_B with their own, leading A to encrypt the payload with a fake key, compromising confidentiality. However, even if PK_B is genuine, the payload’s authenticity remains unproven.  

### Conclusion:
B cannot weakly authenticate A’s payload on Kf because there is no cryptographic binding between the payload and A’s identity. The protocol relies solely on Kf’s public availability and unauthenticated ID strings, enabling attackers to forge valid-looking payloads that B would incorrectly attribute to A.  

**Answer:** Protocol Ten does not fulfill the intended security property. B cannot weakly authenticate A on Kf due to the lack of authentication mechanisms linking the payload to A and the public exposure of Kf, allowing forgery.
