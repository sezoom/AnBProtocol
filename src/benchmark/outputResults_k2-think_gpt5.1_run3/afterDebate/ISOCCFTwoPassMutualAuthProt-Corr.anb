**Explanation of Changes:**
1. Removed `Function mac;` from the `Types` section to eliminate duplication with the `Declarations` section, as `mac` is declared as a 2-arity constructor there.
2. Omitted the `Mapping` line from `Types` since no mappings are used, correcting the syntactic error of `Mapping ;`.
3. Updated the `mac` usage in `Actions [m2]` to `mac(NB . B . Text2, skAB)` to align with the arity-based declaration `mac/2;`.
4. Ensured the `ChannelKeys` section is explicitly present and empty, adhering to style guidelines.
5. Retained the goal `B ->* A : Text2;` assuming non-injective authentication is intended, as no intent mismatch was specified.
