Protocol Asym:

Declarations:
    aenc/2;

Types:
    Agent A,B;
    Number n;

Knowledge:
    A : A, pk(A), sk(A), pk(B), B;
    B : B, pk(B), sk(B), pk(A), A;

Public:
    A,B,pk(A),pk(B);

Private:
    sk(A), sk(B);

Actions:
    [m1] A -> B (n) : aenc{ n }pk(B);  % Public-key encryption using B's public key to ensure confidentiality

Goals:
    B -> A : n;  % Goal: B decrypts the received message and sends n back to A

ChannelKeys:
    % Empty section; no channel-specific keys are required; protocol uses agent public/private keys.
end

**Explanation of Changes:**  
1. **Types Section:** Removed empty type declarations (`Data ;`, `Symmetric_key ;`, `Function ;`) as they are unused and semantically odd per feedback.  
2. **Actions Section:** Adjusted encryption key from `sk(A)` (A’s private key) to `pk(B)` (B’s public key) to align with public-key encryption semantics for confidentiality, assuming the intent is for A to send n confidentially to B. Added a comment to clarify the encryption purpose.  
3. **ChannelKeys Section:** Added a comment to explain the empty section, adhering to guidelines for clarity.  
4. **Goals Section:** Retained the original goal but added a comment to clarify that B’s sending of n to A follows decryption of the encrypted message.  

All syntactic and structural requirements (sections, declarations, message format) are maintained, and semantic clarity is improved.
