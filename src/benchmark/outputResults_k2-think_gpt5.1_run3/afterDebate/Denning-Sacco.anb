**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Declarations Section:** Removed the syntactically odd `Function ;` and `Mapping ;` lines since there are no functions or mappings to declare, improving syntactic consistency.

2. **Private Section:** Removed `KAB` and `t` from the `Private` list. This resolves the conceptual inconsistency where they were previously modeled as global private constants but intended to be session-specific fresh variables generated by S in message `[m2]`.

3. **Freshness in Message [m2]:** Retained `(KAB, t)` in the freshness list of `[m2]` to correctly model them as session-specific values generated by S during each protocol execution. This aligns with their intended use as a newly created session key (`KAB`) and nonce (`t`).

4. **Consistency Checks:** Verified that all other sections (Types, Knowledge, Public, Actions, Goals, ChannelKeys) remain consistent with the updated modeling. The encryption syntax, concatenation, and goal definitions are unchanged and still valid.
