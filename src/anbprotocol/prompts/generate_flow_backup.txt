Read the input and parse it to Alice and Bob style for cryptographic protocol spec.

Rules:
- Prefer roles named Alice and Bob when equivalent to client/server or any two parties.
- Define the Parties initial knowledge
- Use clear steps: sender -> receiver: content
- Include generation of fresh values (e.g., NA, NB) at the first moment they exist.
- Reference key operations (sign, encrypt, kdf) inline.
- Keep it concise and consistent.

 * Title: Description of the Needham Schroeder public key protocol and its attack
 * Link: https://members.loria.fr/VCortier/files/School/NS.pdf
 */

The Needham Schroeder public key protocol can be described as follows:
   A --> B: {{A,Na}}pub(B)
   B --> A: {{Na,Nb}}pub(A)
   A --> B: {{Nb}}pub(B)
 Initial knowledge:
   We suppose that agents A and B initially know public keys pub(C) of agent C, for any agent C.
 Data generated during the protocol:
   Na is a nonce generated by A. Nb is a nonce generated by B.
 Protocol description:
   Alice starts the protocol by sending her identity A together with a freshly generated random number Na.
   This message is encrypted using an asymmetric encryption algorithm with B’s public key (denoted pub(B)).
   We suppose that only agent Bob (whose identity is B) knows the secret key corresponding to pub(B).
   Next Bobreceives the message {{A,Na}}pub(B) sent by Alice. Using his private key, Bob decrypts the message.
   He sends the received nonce Na together with a freshly generated nonce Nb encrypted with A’s public key (pub(A)) to Alice.
   Finally Alice receives the message {{Na,Nb}}pub(A).
   She decrypts the message and checks that the nonce NA corresponds to the nonce previously generated and sent to Bob.
   She sends the nonce Nb to Bob encrypted with Bob’s public key.
   Upon reception of this message Bob decrypts it and checks that the nonce corresponds to the one previously generated.
