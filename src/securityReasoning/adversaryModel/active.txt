Active Adversary Model

Intuition
The Dolev–Yao adversary is assumed to have complete control over the network: they can intercept, block, modify, replay, and inject arbitrary messages.

Capabilities
	1.	Control the network
	2.	Act as any role in the protocol
	3.	Use cryptographic operations symbolically
        - The adversary can encrypt data if they know the plaintext and the key.
        - Can decrypt ciphertexts if they know the correct key.
        - Can verify signatures if they know the corresponding public key.
        - Can generate signatures if they have the signing key.
        - Can compute hashes or MACs on any inputs they know.
	    - They can freely combine and decompose structured messages using the public operators and constructors of the term algebra.
	4.	Corrupt keys after the fact:
	    - In some analyses we consider what happens if the adversary later learns certain long-term keys and then tries to decrypt previously recorded traffic.

Limitations
they still cannot:
	1.	Break ideal cryptography
	2.	Exploit out-of-model vulnerabilities
	    - Cannot perform side-channel attacks, timing attacks, or implementation-level exploits unless these are explicitly included in the model.
	    - Cannot use parsing bugs, memory corruption, or API misuse not described in the abstract protocol specification.
