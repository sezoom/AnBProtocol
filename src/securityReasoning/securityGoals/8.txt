Session Uniqueness:
	- For any given traffic key, there is at most one honest initiator session and at most one honest responder session using that key.
	- For any given handshake transcript, there is at most one honest initiator session and at most one honest responder session corresponding to it.

=== Input ===
{protocol}

=== Task ==
Analyze:
	1.	Describe the session parameters (nonces, ephemeral keys, session IDs, etc.) and how they are chosen (fresh randomness vs reused values).
	2.	Explain how traffic keys are computed from these parameters.
	3.	Try to construct an attack or scenario where:
	    - an honest party starts two logically distinct initiator sessions that both end with the same traffic key, or
	    - an honest party starts two distinct responder sessions that both end with the same traffic key, or
	    - two distinct initiator sessions (or two distinct responder sessions) share the same handshake transcript.
	4.	If you find such a scenario, describe it step by step and argue why these are genuinely different sessions (not just redundant views of the same run).

Based on your reasoning, state whether the protocol satisfies Session Uniqueness or is vulnerable to session merging / duplication.

==== Output Format (Restricted) ====
<yes/no> where yes if the protocol secure and no otherwise
<justification> if the protocol is not secure in short specific reasoning.
