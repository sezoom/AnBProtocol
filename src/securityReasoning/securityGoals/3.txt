Forward Secrecy:
For every run and every completed session between honest parties, assume that:
{attackerModel}
	- after the session ends and sender and recipient delete all session keys and chaining keys, the adversary learns all static private keys and any pre-shared keys involved in the protocol.

Then the adversary cannot reconstruct the cleartext of the session’s application data messages.

=== Task ==
Using this definition, determine whether the protocol has Forward Secrecy or not, and justify your reasoning.

=== Input ===
{protocol}

==== Output Format (Restricted) ====
<yes/no> if the goal hold or not
<justification> if the goal doesn't hold in short specific reasoning.

No need for a summary section
