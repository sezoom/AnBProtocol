Secrecy:
For every run in which:
    - the endpoints of the channel are honest,
	- the transport message of type Data or any term defined as private is sent over that channel, and
	- the attacker does not initially know the traffic key,

{attackerModel}

=== Input ===
{protocol}

=== Task ==
	- Identify messages and the traffic key in the protocol, then argue whether Transport-Secrecy holds.

==== Output Format (Restricted) ====
<yes/no> where yes if the secrecy hold and no otherwise
<justification> if the goal doesn't hold in short specific reasoning.

No need for a summary section
