Identity Hiding:
By watching the network traffic of a single session, an adversary who does not know any static private keys at that time must not be able to infer which static long-term keys / identities are participating in that session.

=== Input ===
{protocol}

=== Task ==
Analyze:
how static identities or static keys appear in the protocol:
	•	Are they sent in the clear?
	•	Encrypted under some key?
	•	Implicitly encoded in signatures, ciphertext structure, or certificates?

Based on your reasoning, state whether the protocol satisfy Identity Hiding or not

==== Output Format (Restricted) ====
<yes/no> if the protocol satisfy Identity Hiding or not
<justification> if the protocol is not secure in short specific reasoning.
