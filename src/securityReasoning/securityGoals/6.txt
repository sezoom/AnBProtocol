Resistance against Identity Mis-Binding/unknown key-share attacks, where:
	- Two honest parties end up with the same traffic key for a session,
	- But at least one of them is mistaken about which peer they share that key with.

{attackerModel}

=== Input ===
{protocol}

=== Task ==
Analyze the protocol as follows:
	1-	Describe how session/traffic keys are computed, including which inputs (nonces, ephemeral keys, static keys, identities, roles) are used.
	2- Try to build a scenario where:
	    - Honest party U completes a session and associates the derived key with peer identity 'X',
	    - Honest party V completes a session and associates the same key with peer identity 'Y',
	    - and either X ≠ V or Y ≠ U
	3.	If such a scenario exists, write it as a concrete message trace and explain why both honest parties accept, and why their views of the peer identity differ.

Based on your reasoning, state whether the protocol is:
	•	resistant to identity mis-binding / UKS attacks, or not

==== Output Format (Restricted) ====
<yes/no> where yes if the protocol resistant to identity mis-binding / UKS attacks otherwise no
<justification> if the protocol is not secure in short specific reasoning.

No need for a summary section
